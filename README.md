# What-s-in-an-Avocado-Toast-A-Supply-Chain-Analysis

Descripci√≥n del proyecto

In this project, you'll apply your data manipulation and analysis skills to conduct a supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in an avocado toast, using the data from Open Food Facts. This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. This analysis, you will give you an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish.

Apply your data manipulation and analysis skills to investigate the supply chain of ingredients for making avocado toast in the U.K. Your task is to determine the following information:

The name of the most common country of origin for each of the three key ingredients: avocados, olive oil, and sourdough.
Store the most common country of origin for each ingredient in the following variables: top_avocado_origin, top_olive_oil_origin, and top_sourdough_origin. Ensure that the country names contain only letters (A-Z) and spaces, with no hyphens or other characters.

To focus your analysis, subset each of the DataFrames to include only these relevant columns: 'code', 'lc', 'productnameen', 'quantity', 'servingsize', 'packagingtags', 'brands', 'brandstags', 'categoriestags', 'labelstags', 'countries', 'countriestags', 'origins', 'origins_tags'.

After completing this project, feel free to explore other questions using the food data!
